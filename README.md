# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my first JavaScript project.

I have to create a game of Rock, Paper and Scissors. Happy coding!

Completed!!

It is a typical Rock Paper Scissors game. You play the game against the Computer and First to 5 wins the Game. Try it and it will be Fun. Don't let the machine defeat you.

It was a tough one. Took 2 days to complete.
I made the project on the other operating system and did not commit changes to Git. (Sorry)
But i have made a seperate folder of all the different changes i made to the program till it reached the final masterpiece.
If you want to see, i can send it.

Working with for loop was the tough one. Did not study loops or used them before this so it was hard figuring it out.

But this was my first JS project. There will be many more to come so need to be fired up!!

Happy Coding!! :)
